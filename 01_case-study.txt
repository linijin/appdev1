Case Study
Managing a Challenging Cross-Department Collaboration

As a software manager, I oversee a development team that handles various projects. Recently, another department approached me with a request for a joint effort. They were seeking help from our software engineers to support their team in the Research and Development (R&D) department, as they were facing tight deadlines. The challenge was clear: the R&D department needed assistance to meet their target dates, and we had to step in and assist, despite the fact that there was a significant learning curve involved.

Although the schedule was already very tight, we decided to lend our support to help them meet their goals. Despite the initial challenges, the collaboration showed promising progress. However, as we were nearing the end of the project and approaching the target deadline, one of my developers faced a personal family crisis, which unfortunately disrupted our progress and further jeopardized our ability to meet the deadline.

Questions for Consideration:

1. As a Manager: How would you handle the situation when a key team member faces a personal issue that affects the project timeline? What steps would you take to ensure the team stays on track, and how would you communicate with both the client and your team?

As a manager, I’ll acknowledge his situation and encourage him to take the time he needs, offering my full support. To keep the project on track, I’ll reassign his tasks by determining which team members can step in temporarily or, if necessary, seek help from other departments to cover the workload. I’ll also inform both the client and the team about these unexpected challenges, assuring them that we’re committed to meeting the deadline and keeping them updated on our progress and solutions. 

2. As a Developer: If you were the one facing a family emergency, how would you handle the situation to ensure that it doesn't negatively impact the project timeline? What actions would you take to manage your workload, communicate effectively with your manager, and ensure the project stays on course?

As a developer, I'll start by attempting to explain my situation to our software manager. Inquire about his thoughts on how I should handle both my own issues and the job I have been given. I will document my in-process tasks to assist the person temporarily taking over some of my responsibilities. Undoubtedly, the crucial duty that has been assigned to me alone and cannot be shared with anybody else will be handled by me. This will allow me to contribute very little to the project and concentrate on my personal circumstances.

3. What Could Have Been Done Better?: Reflect on how both the manager and the developer could have better anticipated potential risks and mitigated issues before they arose. What strategies might have helped avoid this situation or managed it more effectively?

The manager and developer could have chosen backup team members to handle important tasks if problems came up. Cross-training or training team members to cover each other’s work and open communication strategies would help the team respond quickly to unexpected issues and reduce their impact.
